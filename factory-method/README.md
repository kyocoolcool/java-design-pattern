# Factory Method

## Purpose

> A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that
> just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object
> but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate.
> In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.

## Advantage of Factory Method Pattern
> You avoid tight coupling between the creator and the concrete products.    
> Single Responsibility Principle. You can move the product creation code into one place in the program, making the code easier to support.     
> Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new types of products into the program without breaking existing client code.    

## Disadvantage of Factory Method Pattern
> The code may become more complicated since you need to introduce a lot of 
> new subclasses to implement the pattern. The best case scenario is when youâ€™re
> introducing the pattern into an existing hierarchy of creator classes.

## Usage of Factory Design Pattern

> When a class doesn't know what sub-classes will be required to create.    
> When a class wants that its sub-classes specify the objects to be created.     
> When the parent classes choose the creation of objects to its sub-classes.

## The pattern is present in core Java libraries:

> java.util.Calendar#getInstance()
