# Prototype

## Purpose

> Cloning of an existing object instead of creating new one and can also be customized as per the requirement.

## Advantage of Prototype Design Pattern
> You can clone objects without coupling to their concrete classes.     
> You can get rid of repeated initialization code in favor of cloning pre-built prototypes.     
> You can produce complex objects more conveniently.    
> You get an alternative to inheritance when dealing with configuration presets for complex objects.

## Disadvantage of Prototype Design Pattern
> Cloning complex objects that have circular references might be very tricky.

## Usage of Prototype Pattern

> When the classes are instantiated at runtime.
> When the cost of creating an object is expensive or complicated.
> When you want to keep the number of classes in an application minimum.
> When the client application needs to be unaware of object creation and representation.
